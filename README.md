## Getting Started

First you will need to download all the dependencies of the project! In a command terminal (CLI) make sure you are inside the project folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

Once all dependencies have been downloaded, the next step is to mount our application on a local server. To do this, we will write the command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Now, open [http://localhost:3000/people-and-cats](http://localhost:3000/people-and-cats) with your browser to see the result.

You can also view the application from the Vercel domain by entering: [https://people-and-cats-ajqgth6t4-javier-trejos-projects.vercel.app/people-and-cats](https://people-and-cats-ajqgth6t4-javier-trejos-projects.vercel.app/people-and-cats)
