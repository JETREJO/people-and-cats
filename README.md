## Getting Started

First you will need to download all the dependencies of the project! In a command terminal (CLI) make sure you are inside the project folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

Once all dependencies have been downloaded, the next step is to mount our application on a local server. To do this, we will write the command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Now, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
